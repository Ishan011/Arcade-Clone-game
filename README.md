Beat the bugs...Get the gems..._Win the game ;)_

## About
This project is a part of **UDACITY's Frontend Nanodegree**.
I have used HTML/CSS/Javascript to design and create this game.
Make sure to check it out! 
I have used comments everywhere I could to make it easier for anyone to understand.I am open to suggestions
so let me know if I could make this better.Thank you!

## How to Play
<ol>
  <li>Download/Clone this repository.</li>
  <li>Open index.html in your browser.</li>
  <li>Enjoy the game :)</li>
</ol>

## Instructions
### Basic Functionality
<ul>
  <li>The player can move left, right, up and down. </li>
  <li>The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board.</li>
  <li>Player's position resets as soon as the player reaches water. </li>
  <li>Once a the player collides with an enemy, the modal displays along with his/her score. </li>
  <li>Collectibles: Gems show up along the path of bugs! </li>
  <li>Press F5 to reload/reset the game. </li>
</ul>

### How the Game Works
The idea behind this game is quite simple one. It comes under **hypercasual games** category. Game only ends once you _collide with the bugs_.There's a certain cutoff above which player technically wins the game.Generally,more fun with friends trying to beat each other's high scores.

To win the game:-
-------------------
<ul>
  <li>Player is suppose to collect gems that will display at any paved block portions of the game board.</li>
  <li>To make it challenging user get only "1 Life".</li>
  <li>In order to win the game score has to be 125 or above.</li>
</ul>

## Dependencies
This game couldn't have been made possible without starter pack of Udacity which included canvas and sprites required to fulfill this game.
Also uses GoogleAPIs to make use of Google Fonts.
So thanks to them for making all this possible!
